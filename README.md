# Hi, I'm Emmanuel Yaw Inkum! 👋

## 🌟 About Me
I am a results-driven Data Scientist and Data Analyst with a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience in delivering data-driven solutions that inform business strategy and enhance operational performance. I hold an MSc in Data Science from Robert Gordon University and an MSc in Applied Statistics from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, complemented by a BSc in Economics with Computing and an HND in Statistics.

My expertise spans across data analytics, machine learning, statistical modeling, and business intelligence. I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, Power BI, and Excel, with a proven ability to collect, clean, and transform large datasets into actionable insights. I have applied these skills in diverse sectors including digital banking, business operations, and research analytics.

In my recent roles, I led key data projects that improved data accuracy, optimized resource allocation, and enabled predictive modeling using explainable AI techniques. I’ve also developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize performance metrics and support data-driven decision-making at the executive level.

I am passionate about solving complex problems through data, committed to continuous learning, and driven by a desire to create meaningful impact through analytics and innovation.

## 🔭 Featured Projects
- 🧠 [Loan-Default Prediction & ExplainableAI](https://inkumsah2012.shinyapps.io/Loan/): Analysis for predicting loan default rates and the use of explainable AI in the contributing factors.
- 📈 [Power BI-Inventory-Dashboard ](https://github.com/inkumsah2012/Powerbi-inventory-dashboard)   :[Blog   ](https://inkumsah2012.github.io/Powerbi-inventory-dashboard): This project visualizes and analyzes inventory consumption trends, purchasing patterns, and stock alerts using Power BI. It is built from a real-world E-Commerce Inventory Dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dashboard helps businesses make data-driven decisions by providing a comprehensive overview of inventory flow, low stock alerts, and location-based performance.
- 🧠 [Inventory Forecasting with LSTM](https://github.com/inkumsah2012/inventory-flask-app): A production‑ready, end‑to‑end machine‑learning pipeline that predicts next‑day inventory ending quantity from historical consumption data. The project couples an LSTM time‑series model with a Flask micro‑service so you can serve predictions through a lightweight web API or browser‑based form.
- 🧠 [Smart AI Predictor](https://github.com/inkumsah2012/smart-ai-predictor): An AI model for predicting [specific task].
- 📈 [Stock Market Analyzer](https://github.com/inkumsah2012/stock-market-analyzer): A Python-based tool for analyzing stock trends.
